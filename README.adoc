WARNING: This gem is still under development.

== Functionality

This gem processes http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] documents following
a template for generating RSD documents.

The gem currently inherits from the https://github.com/riboseinc/asciidoctor-iso
gem, and aligns closely to it. Refer to the ISO gem
for guidance, including https://github.com/riboseinc/asciidoctor-iso/wiki/Guidance-for-authoring

The following outputs are generated.

* (Optional) An HTML preview generated directly from the Asciidoctor document,
using native Asciidoctor formatting.
** http://asciimath.org[AsciiMathML] is to be used for mathematical formatting.
The gem uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciimath[Ruby AsciiMath parser],
which is syntactically stricter than the common MathJax processor;
if you do not get expected results, try bracketing terms your in AsciiMathML
expressions.
* an XML representation of the document, intended as a document model for RSD
International Standards.
* The XML representation is processed in turn to generate the following outputs
as end deliverable RSD standard drafts.
** DOC
** HTML

This AsciiDoc syntax for writing RSD standards is hereby named "AsciiRSD".

== Usage

The preferred way to invoke this gem is via the `metanorma` script:

[source,console]
----
$ metanorma --type rsd a.adoc                   # output HTML and DOC
$ metanorma --type rsd --extensions html a.adoc # output just HTML
$ metanorma --type rsd --extensions doc a.adoc  # output just DOC
$ metanorma --type rsd --extensions xml a.adoc  # output RSD XML
----

The gem translates the document into RSD XML format, and then
validates its output against the RSD XML document model; errors are
reported to console against the XML, and are intended for users to
check that they have provided all necessary components of the
document.

The gem then converts the XML into HTML and PDF.

The gem can also be invoked directly within asciidoctor, though this is deprecated:

[source,console]
----
$ asciidoctor -b rsd -r 'asciidoctor-rsd' a.adoc  
----

=== Installation

If you are using a Mac, the https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup
repository has instructions on setting up your machine to run Metanorma
scripts such as this one. You need only run the following in a Terminal console:

[source,console]
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup/master/metanorma-setup)
$ gem install asciidoctor-rsd
----


== Approach

=== Document model

The Ribose Standard Document model is an instance of the
https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc-models[StandardDocument model].

The RSD format ("RSD XML") intends to introduce rigor into the RSD
standards authoring process, and is prescribed in a separate document.

RSD XML is still under development, but it already contains all the markup
needed to render a RSD document into HTML.

WARNING: The current RNG model of RSD XML is out of sync with the UML.

=== Asciidoctor

Asciidoctor has been selected as the authoring tool to generate the document
model representation of RSD standards. It is a document formatting tool like
Markdown and DocBook, which combines the relative ease of use of the former
(using relatively lightweight markup), and the rigor and expressively of the
latter (it has a well-defined syntax, and was in fact initially developed as a
DocBook document authoring tool). Asciidoctor has built-in capability to output
Text, DocBook and HTML; so it can be used to preview the file as it is being
authored.

Note that in order to generate HTML preview output close to what is intended
in the RSD standard, the Asciidoc
document includes a fair amount of formatting instructions (e.g. disabling
section numbering where appropriate, the titling of Appendixes as Annexes), as
well as RSD boilerplate text, and predefined section headers (sections are
recognised by fixed titles such as `Normative References`). Authoring RSD
standards in this fashion assumes that users will be populating an Asciidoc
template, and not removing needed formatting instructions.

== Document Attributes

The gem relies on Asciidoctor document attributes to provide necessary
metadata about the document. These include:

`:edition:`:: The document edition

`:revdate:`:: The date the document was last updated

`:copyright-year:`:: The year which will be claimed as when the copyright for
the document was issued

`:title:`:: The main component of the English title of the document
(mandatory). (The first line of the AsciiDoc document, which contains the title
introduced with `=`, is ignored)

`:doctype:`:: The document type (see RSD deliverables: The different types of
RSD publications) (mandatory). The permitted types are:
+
--
* policy-and-procedures
* best-practices
* supporting-document
* report
* legal
* directives
* proposal
* standard
--

`:status:``:: The document status. The permitted types are: `proposal`,
`working-draft`, `committee-draft`, `draft-standard`, `final-draft`,
`published`, `withdrawn`.

`:committee:`:: The name of the relevant RSD committee (mandatory)
`:committee-type:`:: The type of the relevant RSD committee (mandatory): `technical`
or `provisional`.

`:language:` :: The language of the document (only `en` for now)  (mandatory)

`:security:` :: Security level classification, e.g., "confidential", "client confidential"

The attribute `:draft:`, if present, includes review notes in the XML output;
these are otherwise suppressed.

== AsciiRSD features not also present in AsciiISO

* `+[keyword]#...#+`: encodes keywords, such as "MUST", "MUST NOT". (Encoded as
`<span class="keyword">...</span>`.

== Data Models

The RSD Standard Document format is an instance of the
https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc-models[StandardDocument model]. Details of
this general model can be found on its page. Details of the RSD modifications
to this general model can be found on the https://github.com/riboseinc/rsd[RSD model]
repository.

== Examples

* link:spec/examples/rfc6350.adoc[] is an AsciiRSD version of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350[RFC 6350].
* link:spec/examples/rfc6350.html[] is an HTML file generated from the AsciiRSD.
* link:spec/examples/rfc6350.doc[] is a Word document generated from the AsciiRSD.
